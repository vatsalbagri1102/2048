As students at UCSD, many of us have experienced some level of anxiety during the registration process in each quarter as shown by this article where it mentions, \"for many students, it has become a common occurrence to worry about what classes they may or may not get into\" <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) .

At UCSD, course scheduling has been a serious issue, with many professors and students complaining about the lack of seats in university courses <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) .

They also pointed out that 44% of university classes are completely filled, with almost half of these classes filling up on the first pass. <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) However, their work was based on data from the winter quarter of 2020 and did not include courses in the CSE major.
